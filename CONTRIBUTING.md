## Contributing

Please use the following workflow to contribute:

* Fork the repository
* Create a branch which accurately describes your fix or feature (prefix branches with `fix/`, `feat/`, `docs/`, etc). 
* Submit a pull request against `master`

*Note:* A minimum of 1 approving review is required to merge. Squash merges are preferred unless there are very few commits to merge
